# Ansible Notes

### Installation

```bash
pip install ansible
ansible --version
```

### Some quick adhoc commands

Setup inventory

```bash
ansible -i linux.yml all -m ping
ansible -i linux.yml all -m command -a "uptime"
ansible -i linux.yml all -m command -a "df -h"

ansible -i windows.yml all -m win_ping
ansible -i windows.yml all -m win_command -a "hostname"
ansible -i windows.yml all -m win_command -a "java -version"
```

```ansible.cfg
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```

### Ansible Architecture

ANSIBLE IS AGENTLESS! No need to install ansible in remote nodes.

- Control node:

    The machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks and playbooks are run
    
    What needs to be installed:
        - Python
        - Ansible

- Managed node (hosts):

    The servers (nodes) you manage with Ansible. Thereâ€™s no need to install Ansible on these nodes, as the control node communicates with them using SSH or WinRM.

    What needs to be installed:
        - Python for linux nodes
        - WinRM and PowerShell for windows nodes

### How ansible works:

- playbooks:
    specifies what tasks to run

- inventory:
    defines target managed nodes (Linux, Windows, network devices, cloud instances).

- connection to managed nodes:
    linus (SSH) (PORT 22)
    windows (WinRM) (PORT 5985/5986)

S1: Execute ansible command

S2: Ansible connects to the nodes in the inventory using SSH/WinRM

S3: Ansible translates YAML playbooks into Python scripts

S4: Control node copies the translated python scripts to the managed nodes (via SSH/SCP for linux and WinRM for windows)

S5: Remote node executes the python scripts using the python interpreter (/usr/bin/python3)

S6: The output is sent back to the Control Node.

S7: Ansible removes the python script and does clean up in remote nodes

+--------------------------+
|      Control Node        |  
| (Runs Ansible CLI, YAML) |  
+--------------------------+
         |
         | Parses YAML & Converts to Python Scripts
         v
+---------------------------------------------------+
| SSH (Linux) / WinRM (Windows)                    |
+---------------------------------------------------+
         |
         | Transfers and Executes Python/PowerShell Scripts
         v
+--------------------------+  +--------------------------+
|    Linux Managed Node    |  |   Windows Managed Node  |
|  - Executes Python       |  |  - Executes PowerShell  |
|  - Installs Packages     |  |  - Manages Services     |
|  - Configures Services   |  |  - Configures Settings  |
+--------------------------+  +--------------------------+

```

*Quick Tip:* You can see the generated Python script by using verbose mode (-vvv):

```bash
ansible all -m ping -vvv
```

### Anisble Playbooks

```bash
ansible-playbook -i linux.yml playbook.yml --check
```
